## Welcome to my personal website 3.0 ##

I built the first version of my website in late 2020 during fall of my sophomore year of college, built solely on HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 

I built the second version of my website in the summer of 2021 during my internship, also built with
the same tools but with more experience. I've maintained it (enough) since then, adding new projects and experiences that I've
been through, but it's time for another revamp and learning opportunity. 

So, January 10, 2025 offically marks the birth of the third version of my website. This time, I'm building it with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.

I'm also using this as an opportunity to learn more about GitHub Actions and the robustness of GitHub in general. In my current role at Lutron Electronics, I am a devops engineer, but we don't use Github, so I'm excited to learn more about it.
